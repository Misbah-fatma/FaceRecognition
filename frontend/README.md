# Face Recognition App

This is a web-based Face Recognition App developed using **React** for the frontend and **Python** (Flask or FastAPI) for the backend AI face recognition logic. The app allows users to interact with AI-powered face recognition functionality for applications in various sectors like education, healthcare, and personal security.

## Features
- Real-time face recognition with AI
- AI-powered authentication
- Customizable for different industries and use cases
- User-friendly interface

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript (ES6+), Bootstrap 5
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Face Recognition Model**: OpenCV, dlib, TensorFlow, or any other face recognition model you prefer

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** (Node package manager)
- **Python 3.7+** (for the backend)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Git** (for version control)

## Backend Setup (Python)

The backend is built using Python. It handles the face recognition logic and communicates with the React frontend via HTTP requests (using APIs).

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

1. **Clone the repository** (if not done already):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-app.git
    cd face-recognition-app
    ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory** (if your Python code is inside a separate folder like `/backend`):

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3. **Set up a Python virtual environment** (recommended to avoid conflicts with other projects):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. **Install the required Python libraries**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   Example `requirements.txt` file:

   ```txt
   flask==2.0.2
   opencv-python==4.5.1.48
   dlib==19.22.0
   tensorflow==2.5.0
   requests==2.25.1
